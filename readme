Here are the steps to get the GUI running:

1.	Download and install NodeJS (you will likely have to add NodeJS to your PATH to run it from a shell):

https://nodejs.org/en/

2.	Download and install MongoDB on your computer (I used “C:\mongodb” as my install directory):

https://www.mongodb.org/

3.	In the cadmium-v2 project folder, edit the file “mongo.bat” to reflect the following directories on your computer:

cd <directory to “bin” folder in the mongodb install directory>
start mongod.exe –dbpath <directory to “cadmium-v2/data” folder on your computer> & start cmd /k <directory to “bin/mongo.exe” in the mongodb install directory>

4.	 After saving the mongo.bat file, run it. Two dialogs will pop up. In one dialog you will see “connecting to: test”
In that dialog type the following:

use acquire

Then type the following using your directory to the c2-gui project’s loadData.js 
(the syntax is very important, make sure to include the quotation marks and use forward slashes in the directory path):

load(“<directory to cadmium-v2/bin/initData/loadData.js>”)

It will return “true” if it worked successfully. If it did not print "true" check the syntax and try again.

5.	From the cadmium-v2 root project folder open a terminal and type the following to download the dependencies:

npm install

While installing, any dependency that prints a "WARN" message can be ignored, however, if it prints "ERR" the error will need to be resolved before continuing. 
A common error is with "node-gyp", if you recieve this error follow the instructions in the link below:

6.	The GUI is now configured and can be run from a shell. The previous configuration steps only need to be completed once, from now on you will only need this step.
Navigate to the cadmium-v2 root directory and type the following:

node server.js

That will start the server. Open your preferred browser and go to:

http://localhost:8080
